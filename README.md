# JourneyInJava

## About This Repository

Welcome to my personal Java repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Java implementations showcasing various algorithms and data structures. These projects range from basic exercises to more complex applications, showcasing my growth and learning journey in Java programming.

## Repository Structure
This repository is neatly organized into three key directories, each containing Java code:

- **Artemis_Tasks**: Engaging Java exercises and challenges to test your programming mettle.
- **Data_structures**: Core Java implementations of essential data structures.
- **Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms, such as Sorting, Searchnig, Hashing and etc.
- **Exams**: Exercises which was on Java midterms and finals.

### Collaborative Work
While this repository hosts a selection of my individual work, the majority of my collaborative projects, especially those related to university coursework, are available in a shared repository. My friend and I have also started a YouTube channel for Java tutorials, primarily aimed at helping fellow students.
