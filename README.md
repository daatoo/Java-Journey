## About This Repository

Welcome to my personal Java repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Java implementations showcasing various algorithms and data structures. These projects range from basic exercises to more complex applications, showcasing my growth and learning journey in Java programming.

## Repository Structure
This repository is neatly organized into four key directories, each containing Java code:

- **Artemis_Tasks**: Engaging Java exercises and challenges to test your programming mettle.
- **Data_structures**: Core Java implementations of essential data structures.


### Key Highlights
- #### Project 1: Spotijy

### Collaborative Work
While this repository hosts a selection of my individual work, the majority of my collaborative projects, especially those related to university coursework, are available in a shared repository. My friend and I have also started a YouTube channel for Java tutorials, primarily aimed at helping fellow students.
