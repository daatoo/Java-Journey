# Java Streams Implementation

This repository contains a custom implementation of Java Streams, a key feature introduced in Java 8 that supports functional-style operations on streams of elements. The implementation is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how streams work under the hood.

## Structure

The repository is organized into several packages:

- `collection`: Contains custom collection classes such as `List`.
- `function`: Includes functional interfaces like `BiConsumer`, `BiFunction`, `BinaryOperator`, `Consumer`, `Function`, `Predicate`, and `Supplier`.
