# Java Streams Implementation

This repository contains a custom implementation of Java Streams, a key feature introduced in Java 8 that supports functional-style operations on streams of elements. The implementation is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how streams work under the hood.

## Structure

The directory is organized into several packages:

- `collection`: Contains custom collection classes such as `List`.
- `function`: Includes functional interfaces like `BiConsumer`, `BiFunction`, `BinaryOperator`, `Consumer`, `Function`, `Predicate`, and `Supplier`.
- `iterator`: Holds iterator-related interfaces like `Iterable` and `Iterator`.
- `stream`: Features the core `Stream` interface with its various methods for intermediate and terminal operations.
- `util`: Provides utility classes such as `Optional`.
