# __Spotijy__

Spotijy is a Java-based application inspired by the popular music streaming service Spotify. This project is designed as an exercise to enhance understanding and skills in Java programming, focusing on object-oriented principles, data structures, and sorting algorithms.

## Features

- ### Song Management:
  - Create and manage song entities with attributes like title, duration, release year, and likes.
- ### Album Creation:
  -  Compile songs into albums, encapsulating a collection of songs.
- ### Artist Profiles:
  -  Create artist entities who can be associated with both albums and individual songs.
- ### Spotijy Main Application:
  -  A central class that provides various functionalities like finding the most liked artist, song, album, etc.

## Sorting Algorithms

One of the key features of Spotijy is the implementation of various sorting algorithms. These are used in the Album class to sort songs based on different criteria:

- ### Sort by Title:
  -  Implements Bubble Sort.
- ### Sort by Duration:
  -  Utilizes Selection Sort.
- ### Sort by Release Year:
  -  Employs Merge Sort.
- ### Sort by Popularity (Likes):
  -  Another application of a chosen sorting algorithm.

These sorting methods enhance the understanding of classic sorting algorithms and their application in real-world scenarios.

## Implementation

This project is developed purely in Java without using any external libraries. The purpose is to build a strong foundation in Java programming, focusing on:

- ### Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
- ### Understanding and implementing sorting algorithms from scratch.
- ### Practice in designing a system of related classes.
